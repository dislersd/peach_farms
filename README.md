## What is this

I'm building a React app around a JSON file of data which I created from the code found in [this repo](https://github.com/dislersd/api_data_fetch_and_manipulate).

This is mostly just practice with React skills but maybe it will turn into something cool?

The data is peach farms in Connecticut (name, phone number, nearby farms) and I have created a graph of all of the farms wich are close to each other.
